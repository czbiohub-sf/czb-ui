      # Using czb-ui, SDS, and Material UI in Tandem


      If a new, app-specific component needs to be made or you would not like to
      use czb-ui's higher level components, it is still possible to use czb-ui
      to import and use the styles.


      ## Using the Styles with Material UI


      The czb-ui made styles are compatible with Material UI. To use the Biohub
      styles with Material UI, install @czb-ui/core and supply the theme to
      MUI's ThemeProvider:


      ```javascript

      // Example with Next.js

      import * as React from 'react';

      import { ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';

      import CssBaseline from '@mui/material/CssBaseline';


      import { biohubTheme } from "@czb-ui/core/theme???"


      export default function MyApp(props) {
        return (
          <ThemeProvider theme={biohubTheme}>
            <CssBaseline />
            <Component {...pageProps} />
          </ThemeProvider>
        );
      }

      ```


      ## Which components from each UI library should I use?


      It is recommended to start seeing if any of the components in czb-ui will
      work for you. If not, see if SDS has the component. Lastly, use the normal
      Material UI library for low level components. The SDS and Material UI
      components will inherit the czb-ui Biohub style as long as you set up the
      ThemeProvider correctly.


      For example, if I wanted a button component, it is best to use SDS' button
      component. For a container component, it is best to use MUI's container
      component.
