      # Welcome to czb-ui!


      czb-ui is a UI library that contains React components for data portals and
      various web apps here at the Biohub.


      It is based off of [Material UI](https://mui.com/ "Material UI website
      link") and [Chan ](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/sci-components "Chan
      Zuckerberg Initiative Science Design System GitHub repository
      link")[Zuckerberg Initiative's Science Design System
      (SDS)](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/sci-components "Chan Zuckerberg
      Initiative Science Design System GitHub repository link"). A blend of
      components between these two libraries are used to build higher level
      components.


      ## "Higher Level Components"


      This library does not serve individual components such as buttons or
      switches. Instead the library has more pre-built, complex components such
      as navigation bars, forms, and banners. These components are used
      throughout the Biohub, whether it's on a data portal or web app. This
      allows for the most consistent experience between them.


      ## Making it easy


      These components make it as straight forward as possible to build a
      website. Other than using code to implement them, a visual editor is
      available also using TinaCMS.


      ## The Packages


      czb-ui currently consists of four separate packages:


      * **@czb-ui/core**: The core package that includes the essential higher
      level components, such as the navigation bar and the footer.

      * **@czb-ui/tina-cms**: A toolkit to use czb-ui with the
      [TinaCMS](https://tina.io "TinaCMS website") content management system.

      * **@czb-ui/forms**: A wrapper around
      [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form
      "react-jsonschema-form GitHub repo"), a library to generate forms with
      JSON, using the czb-ui style.

      * **@czb-ui/biohub-logos**: The Biohub logos as React components.


      Each package is published on npm and can be installed normally with `npm
      install`. Additionally, using the yarn package manager works also.
