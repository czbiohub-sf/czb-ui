      # Welcome to czb-ui!


      czb-ui is a UI library that contains React components for data portals and
      various web apps here at the Biohub.


      It is based off of [Material UI](https://mui.com/ "Material UI website
      link") and [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Science Design System
      (SDS)](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/sci-components "Chan Zuckerberg
      Initiative Science Design System GitHub repository link"). A blend of
      components between these two libraries are used to build higher level
      components.


      ## "Higher Level Components"


      This library does not serve individual components such as buttons or
      switches. Instead the library has more pre-built, complex components such
      as navigation bars, forms, and banners.
