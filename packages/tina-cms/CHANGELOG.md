# @czb-ui/tina-cms

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- f7e2fce: Create @czb-ui/tina-cms library, for easy use of Tina CMS in other projects using czb-ui. A test Tina CMS Next.js app was also made to test this library.

  This library contains a subset of components from czb-ui to use with Tina CMS. Schemas, templates, and block templates are included for a [block-based editing](https://tina.io/docs/editing/blocks/) workflow.
